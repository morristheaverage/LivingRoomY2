# Graphics Coursework

## Running coursework
To run the program including textures I hosted the directory in a local server using
npm http-server

I ran:
```
http-server -p 3000 -c-1
```

This makes the webpage accessible at localhost:3000/src/index.html

## External sources
I acquired my image textures from Google images.
I have used the libraries provided from practicals.
